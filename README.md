## PS3 Trophy Viewer

This is a desktop based .TRP (PS3 trophy file) viewer. PS3 discs store these `.trp` files in their assets in order to have a completed list of all achievements/trophies for that specific game.

### Installation / Usage

1. Download the `PS3TRPViewer.exe` stored in the [Releases](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/PS3TRPViewer/releases) tab.
2. Then run the exe and open your `.trp` file and start viewing and exporting all of the achievement data. Enjoy!

### Technical Details
Playstation 3 games uses a proprietary format for storing their trophy (achievement). 
The format stores a number of "entries" which then contain smaller files such as XML based config files. 
The XML config files list a set of trophies and their corresponding image. 
This tool also incorporates a way to export all of the trophies with their respective achievement name out to a folder.
